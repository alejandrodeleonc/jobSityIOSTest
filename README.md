# jobSityIOSTest


**Initial Setup**

Follow the steps below before running the project to avoid issues.

1. Delete Podfile.lock: Before running the project, make sure to remove the `Podfile.lock` file. You can do this by executing the following command in the project's root directory:
   
   $ rm Podfile.lock

   I accidentally forgot to add the Podfile.lock to the .gitignore file.

2. Run `pod install` command: Ensure that you have CocoaPods installed on your machine. If you don't have it installed, visit https://cocoapods.org for installation instructions. Then, execute the following command in the project's root directory:

   $ pod install

   This command will download the dependencies specified in the `Podfile` and configure them for your project.

**Running the Project**

Now that you have completed the initial setup, follow the appropriate instructions for your development environment and run the project.
